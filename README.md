# aSnippets
## A text snippet chrome extension

Installation Guide
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install all dependencies by running "npm i" in terminal.
3. Build the extension via "npm run build". This will create a new folder in current directory named dist.
4. Open chrome or any chromium browser, go to extensions menu and turn on the developer mode.
5. Click on "load unpacked" option and select the dist folder created in step 3.
6. Congrats! You can now use the extension and added snippets can be accessed in browser's right click menu.

I'm working on to bring it to Firefox too.
